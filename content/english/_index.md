This file is left intentionally empty by default to be backwards compatible with the initial theme setup.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

Markdown supported, ie:

```
# Welcome

Remember that you can also specify a section header for the posts below by configuring the `mainSectionsTitle` parameter in the front matter of this file.

# About

Hello, I am Dikshant Sagar, a second-year Computer Science PhD student at the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at the <b>University of California, Irvine</b> advised by <b>Dr. Pierre Baldi</b>. I earned my master's degree in Computer Science from <b>California State University, Los Angeles</b> and my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from <b>IIIT Delhi</b> in India. My research interests revolve around <b>Machine Learning</b>, <b>Deep Learning</b> and <b>Artificial Intelligence</b>, particularly their applications in <b>Healthcare</b> and <b>Biomedicine</b>. I have worked as a research assistant at the <b>Machine Learning and Sensing Lab</b>, Cal State LA under Dr. Navid Amini, at the <b>Computational Molecular Biology(COMB) Lab</b>, Cal State LA under Dr. Negin Forouzesh and at the <b>Signal and Biomedical Image Processing(SBI) Lab</b>, IIIT Delhi under Dr. Anubha Gupta.
